Minimal weather application which is written with HTML and vanilla Javascript. It uses `OpenWeatherMap API` to provide location and forecast data in user's prefered language. There's also a `dark mode` switch on the right top corner for those in need for more eye pleasing colors in darker environments.

Icons are Dark Sky's awesome `Skycons.`
