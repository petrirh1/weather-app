Minimal weather application which is written with HTML and vanilla Javascript. It uses `OpenWeatherMap API`  to provide location and forecast data, `Yandex.Translate API` on the other hand is used to get some translations to user preferred language. This is automatically provided when user enters the page.

Icons are Dark Sky's awesome `Skycons.`
