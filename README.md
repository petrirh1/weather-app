# weather-app

![alt tag](https://i.imgur.com/SK5Rctb.png "this is just a screenshot")
Minimal weather application which is written with html and vanilla javascript. It uses `Dark Sky` and `HERE` API's to get location and forecast data.
It retrieves current location and forecast automatically.

Since it uses HTML5 Geolocation, it only works on secure origins which includes localhost on most modern browsers.
Though it seems to be working just fine on Microsoft Edge `(desktop version 44.17763.1.0)` but that may change in near future.
